   <releaseNotes>
    # Toastify 1.7.2

    - Corrected version (bug #13508)
    - Added support for Win key in hotkeys (thanks bwp11!)

    # Toastify 1.7.1

    - Support for Spotify v1
      - This support is much more invasive than previous versions due to changes made by Spotify (primarily the removal of the Artist / Track from the title bar). It has some benefits, but also comes with some down sides (we must restart Spotify when launching Toastify). There will also be bugs.
    - Support for Toast positioning on high-DPI screens, you may need to re-position your Toasts
